	<p>Spending Profile is committed to the secure storage of all client data.</p>
	<p>All accounts are protected by SSL encryption, which is the same type of security used in online banking. From the moment you sign into your account, the connection is fully secure, meaning that all information sent between your computer and our server is encrypted by the sender and decrypted by the receiver. This protects against information being intercepted over the Internet, so that the data you enter into the system remains private and confidential.</p>
	<p>All client accounts are protected by a 256-bit encrypted password that cannot be read by anyone, including Spending Profile administrators. It is for this reason that forgotten passwords cannot be retrieved, and a new password must be generated in this event.</p>
	<p>No sensitive banking information is required to use the service. This means that you will never be asked for a credit card number, bank card number, bank account number, or any account access information while using this website to build your spending profile. Please follow the guidelines outlined in our <a href="privacy.php">privacy policy</a> to ensure your security in this regard.</p>
	<p>Payment for services received from Spending Profile is carried out by PayPal over a secure connection. Once clients enter the payment module, they are covered by PayPal`s security agreement. Please review this agreement and contact PayPal directly if you have any questions.</p>
	<p>Spending Profile provides a tool to import transactions from your bank account or credit card. Files downloaded from a bank can contain sensitive banking information. Be sure to remove this information prior to the import by following the instructions provided. We are not responsible for credit card numbers or any banking information that is compromised as a result of being imported in this way.</p>
	<p>We have safeguards in place to detect suspicious activity that may constitute an attempt to compromise the security of client information. For example, if an attempt is made to gain unauthorized access to an account, the user will be automatically logged out of the system, and an alert will be sent to the administration for investigation. There are many scenarios that we consider to be suspicious activity and for which we take pre-emptive action in order to protect client data.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions or concerns about our security agreement, you may write to us at admin@spendingprofile.com.</p>
	<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this agreement. Any changes will be posted, and changes will only apply to activities and information on a going forward, not retroactive, basis.</p>
